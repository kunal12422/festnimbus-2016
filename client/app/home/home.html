    <h1>ABOUT US</h1><br/>
    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-right: 5%;"><span style="font-weight:400;">
        NIMBUS, the annual technical festival of NIT Hamirpur, as a reference to its name, is aura. An aura of knowledge.
        An aura of technology. An aura that is set ablaze with creative ideas, nurtured with dedication and sheer hard work and brought to
        climax by the passion of the students. NIMBUS, in all its spirit is a concoction of the aforenamed qualities. A new fragrance rules
        the air, a hushed murmur is widespread in the whole state and the atmosphere acquires a flamboyant feel.<br/><br/>

        Sprawled across a time span of three days, this fest comprises of events that go a far way in honing the technical and managerial
        skills of students. It is four days of knowledge, exuberance, growth and fun, an end to which always leaves students in anticipation
        for the next year.<br/><br/>

        After ten years, since its unveiling in 2005, NIMBUS has come a long way from new events that test and improve the skills of
        students, being added every year to bigger sponsors coming forward to finance Himachal's grandest and largest technical extravaganza.
